// This program is written to keep track of the amounts of steps "Adam" will walk, 
// with the help of his hands ups before falling.
// Where U - reps when Adam's hands are in the air.
// where D - reps when Adam's hands are down.  

//WRITE A PROGRAM TO ACCEPT THE NUMBER OF TEST CASES
//declare an Integer to accept the number of cases
//Accept an store integer values in the variable name tCases

//WRITE A PROGRAM TO READ THE FILE, WHERE STEPS DETAILS ARE SAVED
//Use fopen() to read the file
//Use a conditional statement to program code to terminate if file couldn't be read

//Use a loop to check value of stepCount inputted

// for i < number of test cases
    //receive input of testString and save it in a Variable
    //declare and initialize stepCount variable

        //Use a for loop to check detials of the testString variable to check for steps
        //use a switch statement to run a conditon on increasing the stepCount or 
        //printing the result depending on the value of testString
            //switch(testString[j])
            //{
                //for (j < 100){
                    //switch(){
                        //case 'U' : increment stepCount 
                        //case 'D' : print setpCount 
                     //}        
                //}
            //}
